# HTTP-analyzer
A pure and simple HTTP analyzer in java.

## Description
HTTP analyzer works with your console. You're going to be prompted to type your URL (remeber to include the protocol http or https), your method (GET/POST/DELETE), if you want just the header or the the body too, then you're done. As simple as it seems.
